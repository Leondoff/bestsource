**BestSource** (usually known as **BS**) is a cross-platform wrapper library around [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org)
that ensures sample/frame accurate access to audio and video by always linearly decoding the input files. With a few tricks to speed
things up and better handle seeking.

It can be used as either a C++ library directly or through the VapourSynth plugin that's included.
